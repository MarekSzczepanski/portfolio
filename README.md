## Stack Used
React + Gatsby, Styled Components, ESLint (Airbnb preset) + Prettier

#### React:
I used React because it's popular and it's my favourite tool to make SPAs.

##### Some of single Page Application (SPA) advantages useful for this app:
* High speed
* Wonderful state management
* Overall development comfort

#### Gatsby:
GatsbyJS is utilized for building fast and performant websites, leveraging a static site generation approach to enhance performance and SEO. With its foundation on React and integration of GraphQL for efficient data management, Gatsby offers a developer-friendly experience.
#### Styled Components
Styled Components is a popular CSS-in-JS library used for styling React components by allowing developers to write actual CSS code within JavaScript files. It enables the creation of dynamic and scoped styles, promoting better encapsulation and reusability of styles in React applications. The library's approach of combining styles and components in a single file simplifies the styling process and enhances the maintainability of code.
#### ESLint:
ESLint helps to write consistent and error-free code. It can be used to enforce coding style rules, detect potential errors, and improve the readability of the code.
##### ESLint's Airbnb Preset:
The Airbnb Preset is a set of rules that follow the Airbnb code style guide. It is a good choice for project teams that want to follow a serious and well known style guide.
##### Prettier:
Prettier is a code formatter that helps in establishing consistent code. It's very handy together with ESLint.
